## 🤔 Who Is David Grace?

Hi, I’m David Grace from Bangalore— Im a Software Engineer , I strive to stay as stack- and domain-agnostic as possible, but I must confess I have a particular affinity for enterprise payment infrastructure and the broader BFSI domain.
My true focus, however, always remains on core engineering principles that meet Fortune 500 and Linux Foundation standards. Whether using Java, Python, or Go, my passion lies in designing, building, and shipping robust financial systems

### 🏗️ How I Build ( Full Lifecycle Engineering ) ? 

1. **Full Lifecycle Engineering:**  
   - Case study → Mental Mapping → HLD/LLD → Prereq Analysis → Lean e2e MVP with TDD & docs 
   - TestOps → OSS Hygiene → Shipping -> DevOps → IaC → Cloud benchmarks → SRE & observability → Full product ownership

2. **Quality Engineering, Not Just Coding:**  
   - DRY, KISS, SOLID.  
   - Modular by default (monolith or microservices).
   - Nuanced tradeoffs—never overengineering. & Robust exception handling, strong test suites
   
3. **FLOSS Advocacy & Governance:**  
   - All flagship products are FLOSS (MIT), modeled after Linux/Oracle-grade repositories.
   - Self-governed, community-driven, with strong vision and enterprise infra.
   
**I believe in making onboarding easy and impact fast—so whoever hires me gets a real engineer, not just a coder.**
