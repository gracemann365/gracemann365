## 🤔 Who Is David Grace?

### Hi, I’m David Grace from Bangalore— Im a Software Engineer , I strive to stay as stack- and domain-agnostic as possible, but I must confess I have a particular affinity for enterprise payment infrastructure and the broader BFSI domain. My true focus, however, always remains on core engineering principles that meet Fortune 500 and Linux Foundation standards.

### 🏗️ How I Build ( Full Lifecycle Engineering ) ? 

1. **Full Lifecycle Engineering:**  
   - Case study → Mental Mapping → HLD/LLD → Prereq Analysis → Lean e2e MVP with TDD & docs 
   - TestOps → OSS Hygiene → Shipping -> DevOps → IaC → Cloud benchmarks → SRE & observability → Full product ownership

2. **Quality Engineering, Not Just Coding:**  
   - DRY, KISS, SOLID.  
   - Modular by default (monolith or microservices).
   - Nuanced tradeoffs—never overengineering. & Robust exception handling, strong test suites
   
3. **FLOSS Advocacy & Governance:**  
   - All flagship products are FLOSS (MIT), modeled after Linux/Oracle-grade repositories.
   - Self-governed, community-driven, with strong vision and enterprise infra.
   
**I believe in making onboarding easy and impact fast—so whoever hires me gets a real engineer, not just a coder.**
