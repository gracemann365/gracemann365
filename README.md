## 💲 Who Is David Grace ?

### Im a Software Engineer , I strive to stay as Stack- and Domain-agnostic , But I Must Confess I have an obesssion for Blockchain Infra & Enterprise Fiat Infra

### 💲 How I Build ( Full Lifecycle Engineering ) ? 

1. **Full Lifecycle Engineering:**  
   - Case study → Mental Mapping → HLD/LLD → Prereq Analysis → Lean e2e MVP with TDD & docs 
   - TestOps → OSS Hygiene → Shipping -> DevOps → IaC → Cloud benchmarks → SRE & observability → Full product ownership

2. **Quality Engineering, Not Just Coding:**  
   - DRY, KISS, SOLID ; Modular by default (monolith or microservices).
   - Nuanced tradeoffs—never overengineering. & Robust exception handling, strong test suite
    
3. **FLOSS Advocacy & Governance:**  
   - All flagship products are FLOSS (MIT), modeled after Linux/Oracle-grade repositories.
   - Self-governed, community-driven, with strong vision and enterprise infra.
